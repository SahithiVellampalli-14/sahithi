      "In those rare, terrifying moments when I’m without Wi-Fi, I realize just how much of what I do on the computer is really what I do on the internet. Out of sheer habit I’ll find myself trying to check email, read friends’ Twitter feeds, or answer the question, “Did Kurtwood Smith have any major roles before he was in the original 1987 RoboCop?”1\n",
      "Since so much work on a computer involves going on the internet, it’d be great if your programs could get online. Web scraping is the term for using a program to download and process content from the web. For example, Google runs many web scraping programs to index web pages for its search engine. In this chapter, you will learn about several modules that make it easy to scrape web pages in Python.\n",
      "webbrowser Comes with Python and opens a browser to a specific page.\n",
      "requests Downloads files and web pages from the internet.\n",
      "bs4 Parses HTML, the format that web pages are written in.\n",
      "selenium Launches and controls a web browser. The selenium module is able to fill in forms and simulate mouse clicks in this browser.\n",
      "Project: mapIt.py with the webbrowser Module\n",
      "The webbrowser module’s open() function can launch a new browser to a specified URL. Enter the following into the interactive shell:\n",
      ">>> import webbrowser\n",
      ">>> webbrowser.open('https://inventwithpython.com/')\n",
      "A web browser tab will open to the URL https://inventwithpython.com/. This is about the only thing the webbrowser module can do. Even so, the open() function does make some interesting things possible. For example, it’s tedious to copy a street address to the clipboard and bring up a map of it on Google Maps. You could take a few steps out of this task by writing a simple script to automatically launch the map in your browser using the contents of your clipboard. This way, you only have to copy the address to a clipboard and run the script, and the map will be loaded for you.\n",
      "This is what your program does:\n",
      "\n",
      "Gets a street address from the command line arguments or clipboard\n",
      "Opens the web browser to the Google Maps page for the address\n",
      "\n",
      "This means your code will need to do the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "Read the command line arguments from sys.argv.\n",
      "Read the clipboard contents.\n",
      "Call the webbrowser.open() function to open the web browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Open a new file editor tab and save it as mapIt.py.\n",
      "Step 1: Figure Out the URL\n",
      "Based on the instructions in Appendix B, set up mapIt.py so that when you run it from the command line, like so . . .\n",
      "C:\\> mapit 870 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110\n",
      ". . . the script will use the command line arguments instead of the clipboard. If there are no command line arguments, then the program will know to use the contents of the clipboard.\n",
      "First you need to figure out what URL to use for a given street address. When you load https://maps.google.com/ in the browser and search for an address, the URL in the address bar looks something like this: https://www.google.com/maps/place/870+Valencia+St/@37.7590311,-122.4215096,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f7e3dadc07a37:0xc86b0b2bb93b73d8.\n",
      "The address is in the URL, but there’s a lot of additional text there as well. Websites often add extra data to URLs to help track visitors or customize sites. But if you try just going to https://www.google.com/maps/place/870+Valencia+St+San+Francisco+CA/, you’ll find that it still brings up the correct page. So your program can be set to open a web browser to 'https://www.google.com/maps/place/your_address_string' (where your_address_string is the address you want to map).\n",
      "Step 2: Handle the Command Line Arguments\n",
      "Make your code look like this:\n",
      "#! python3\n",
      "# mapIt.py - Launches a map in the browser using an address from the\n",
      "# command line or clipboard.\n",
      "import webbrowser, sys\n",
      "if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n",
      "    # Get address from command line.\n",
      "    address = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])\n",
      "# TODO: Get address from clipboard.\n",
      "After the program’s #! shebang line, you need to import the webbrowser module for launching the browser and import the sys module for reading the potential command line arguments. The sys.argv variable stores a list of the program’s filename and command line arguments. If this list has more than just the filename in it, then len(sys.argv) evaluates to an integer greater than 1, meaning that command line arguments have indeed been provided.\n",
      "Command line arguments are usually separated by spaces, but in this case, you want to interpret all of the arguments as a single string. Since sys.argv is a list of strings, you can pass it to the join() method, which returns a single string value. You don’t want the program name in this string, so instead of sys.argv, you should pass sys.argv[1:] to chop off the first element of the array. The final string that this expression evaluates to is stored in the address variable.\n",
      "If you run the program by entering this into the command line . . .\n",
      "mapit 870 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110\n",
      ". . . the sys.argv variable will contain this list value:\n",
      "['mapIt.py', '870', 'Valencia', 'St, ', 'San', 'Francisco, ', 'CA', '94110']\n",
      "The address variable will contain the string '870 Valencia St, San Francisco, CA 94110'.\n",
      "Step 3: Handle the Clipboard Content and Launch the Browser\n",
      "Make your code look like the following:\n",
      "#! python3\n",
      "# mapIt.py - Launches a map in the browser using an address from the\n",
      "# command line or clipboard.\n",
      "import webbrowser, sys, pyperclip\n",
      "if len(sys.argv) > 1:\n",
      "    # Get address from command line.\n",
      "    address = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])\n",
      "else:\n",
      "    # Get address from clipboard.\n",
      "    address = pyperclip.paste()\n",
      "webbrowser.open('https://www.google.com/maps/place/' + address)\n",
      "If there are no command line arguments, the program will assume the address is stored on the clipboard. You can get the clipboard content with pyperclip.paste() and store it in a variable named address. Finally, to launch a web browser with the Google Maps URL, call webbrowser.open().\n",
      "While some of the programs you write will perform huge tasks that save you hours, it can be just as satisfying to use a program that conveniently saves you a few seconds each time you perform a common task, such as getting a map of an address. Table 12-1 compares the steps needed to display a map with and without mapIt.py.\n",

      "The requests module lets you easily download files from the web without having to worry about complicated issues such as network errors, connection problems, and data compression. The requests module doesn’t come with Python, so you’ll have to install it first. From the command line, run pip install --user requests. (Appendix A has additional details on how to install third-party modules.)\n",
      "The requests module was written because Python’s urllib2 module is too complicated to use. In fact, take a permanent marker and black out this entire paragraph. Forget I ever mentioned urllib2. If you need to download things from the web, just use the requests module.\n",

You may already be familiar with the 404 status code for “Not Found.”) You can find a complete list of HTTP status codes and their meanings at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes.\n",
      "If the request succeeded, the downloaded web page is stored as a string in the Response object’s text variable. This variable holds a large string of the entire play; the call to len(res.text) shows you that it is more than 178,000 characters long. Finally, calling print(res.text[:250]) displays only the first 250 characters.\n",
      "If the request failed and displayed an error message, like “Failed to establish a new connection” or “Max retries exceeded,” then check your internet connection. Connecting to servers can be quite complicated, and I can’t give a full list of possible problems here. You can find common causes of your error by doing a web search of the error message in quotes.\n",

First, you must open the file in write binary mode by passing the string 'wb' as the second argument to open(). Even if the page is in plaintext (such as the Romeo and Juliet text you downloaded earlier), you need to write binary data instead of text data in order to maintain the Unicode encoding of the text.\n",

      "HTML\n",
      "Before you pick apart web pages, you’ll learn some HTML basics. You’ll also see how to access your web browser’s powerful developer tools, which will make scraping information from the web much easier.\n",
      "Resources for Learning HTML\n",
      "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the format that web pages are written in. This chapter assumes you have some basic experience with HTML, but if you need a beginner tutorial, I suggest one of the following sites:\n",
      "\n",
      "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/html/\n",
      "https://htmldog.com/guides/html/beginner/\n",
      "https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html\n",
      "\n",
      "A Quick Refresher\n",
      "In case it’s been a while since you’ve looked at any HTML, here’s a quick overview of the basics. An HTML file is a plaintext file with the .html file extension. The text in these files is surrounded by tags, which are words enclosed in angle brackets. The tags tell the browser how to format the web page. A starting tag and closing tag can enclose some text to form an element. The text (or inner HTML) is the content between the starting and closing tags. For example, the following HTML will display Hello, world! in the browser, with Hello in bold:\n",
      "<strong>Hello</strong>, world!\n",
      "This HTML will look like Figure 12-1 in a browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 12-1: Hello, world! rendered in the browser\n",
      "The opening <strong> tag says that the enclosed text will appear in bold. The closing </strong> tags tells the browser where the end of the bold text is.\n",
      "There are many different tags in HTML. Some of these tags have extra properties in the form of attributes within the angle brackets. For example, the <a> tag encloses text that should be a link. The URL that the text links to is determined by the href attribute. Here’s an example:\n",
      "Al's free <a href=\"https://inventwithpython.com\">Python books</a>.\n",
      "This HTML will look like Figure 12-2 in a browser.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 12-2: The link rendered in the browser\n",
      "Some elements have an id attribute that is used to uniquely identify the element in the page. You will often instruct your programs to seek out an element by its id attribute, so figuring out an element’s id attribute using the browser’s developer tools is a common task in writing web scraping programs.\n",
      "Viewing the Source HTML of a Web Page\n",
      "You’ll need to look at the HTML source of the web pages that your programs will work with. To do this, right-click (or CTRL-click on macOS) any web page in your web browser, and select View Source or View page source to see the HTML text of the page (see Figure 12-3). This is the text your browser actually receives. The browser knows how to display, or render, the web page from this HTML.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 12-3: Viewing the source of a web page\n",
      "I highly recommend viewing the source HTML of some of your favorite sites. It’s fine if you don’t fully understand what you are seeing when you look at the source. You won’t need HTML mastery to write simple web scraping programs—after all, you won’t be writing your own websites. You just need enough knowledge to pick out data from an existing site.\n",
      "Opening Your Browser’s Developer Tools\n",
      "In addition to viewing a web page’s source, you can look through a page’s HTML using your browser’s developer tools. In Chrome and Internet Explorer for Windows, the developer tools are already installed, and you can press F12 to make them appear (see Figure 12-4). Pressing F12 again will make the developer tools disappear. In Chrome, you can also bring up the developer tools by selecting View ▸ Developer ▸ Developer Tools. In macOS, pressing -OPTION-I will open Chrome’s Developer Tools.\n",

      "In Safari, open the Preferences window, and on the Advanced pane check the Show Develop menu in the menu bar option. After it has been enabled, you can bring up the developer tools by pressing -OPTION-I.\n",
      "After enabling or installing the developer tools in your browser, you can right-click any part of the web page and select Inspect Element from the context menu to bring up the HTML responsible for that part of the page. This will be helpful when you begin to parse HTML for your web scraping programs.\n",
      "\n",
      "DON’T USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS TO PARSE HTML\n",
      "Locating a specific piece of HTML in a string seems like a perfect case for regular expressions. However, I advise you against it. There are many different ways that HTML can be formatted and still be considered valid HTML, but trying to capture all these possible variations in a regular expression can be tedious and error prone. A module developed specifically for parsing HTML, such as bs4, will be less likely to result in bugs.\n",
      "You can find an extended argument for why you shouldn’t parse HTML with regular expressions at https://stackoverflow.com/a/1732454/1893164/.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using the Developer Tools to Find HTML Elements\n",
      "Once your program has downloaded a web page using the requests module, you will have the page’s HTML content as a single string value. Now you need to figure out which part of the HTML corresponds to the information on the web page you’re interested in.\n",
      "This is where the browser’s developer tools can help. Say you want to write a program to pull weather forecast data from https://weather.gov/. Before writing any code, do a little research. If you visit the site and search for the 94105 ZIP code, the site will take you to a page showing the forecast for that area.\n",
      "What if you’re interested in scraping the weather information for that ZIP code? Right-click where it is on the page (or CONTROL-click on macOS) and select Inspect Element from the context menu that appears. This will bring up the Developer Tools window, which shows you the HTML that produces this particular part of the web page. Figure 12-5 shows the developer tools open to the HTML of the nearest forecast. Note that if the https://weather.gov/ site changes the design of its web pages, you’ll need to repeat this process to inspect the new elements.\n",
      "\n",
      "Figure 12-5: Inspecting the element that holds forecast text with the developer tools\n",
      "From the developer tools, you can see that the HTML responsible for the forecast part of the web page is <div class=\"col-sm-10 forecast-text\">Sunny, with a high near 64. West wind 11 to 16 mph, with gusts as high as 21 mph.</div>. This is exactly what you were looking for! It seems that the forecast information is contained inside a <div> element with the forecast-text CSS class. Right-click on this element in the browser’s developer console, and from the context menu that appears, select Copy ▸ CSS Selector. This will copy a string such as 'div.row-odd:nth-child(1) > div:nth-child(2)' to the clipboard. You can use this string for Beautiful Soup’s select() or Selenium’s find_element_by_css_selector() methods, as explained later in this chapter. Now that you know what you’re looking for, the Beautiful Soup module will help you find it in the string.\n",

      "Beautiful Soup is a module for extracting information from an HTML page (and is much better for this purpose than regular expressions). The Beautiful Soup module’s name is bs4 (for Beautiful Soup, version 4). To install it, you will need to run pip install --user beautifulsoup4 from the command line. (Check out Appendix A for instructions on installing third-party modules.) While beautifulsoup4 is the name used for installation, to import Beautiful Soup you run import bs4.\n",

      "Whenever I search a topic on Google, I don’t look at just one search result at a time. By middle-clicking a search result link (or clicking while holding CTRL), I open the first several links in a bunch of new tabs to read later. I search Google often enough that this workflow—opening my browser, searching for a topic, and middle-clicking several links one by one—is tedious. It would be nice if I could simply type a search term on the command line and have my computer automatically open a browser with all the top search results in new tabs. Let’s write a script to do this with the search results page for the Python Package Index at https://pypi.org/. A program like this can be adapted to many other websites, although the Google and DuckDuckGo often employ measures that make scraping their search results pages difficult.\n",
      "This is what your program does:\n",

      "\n",
      "Open a new file editor tab and save it as searchpypi.py.\n",
      "Step 1: Get the Command Line Arguments and Request the Search Page\n",
      "Before coding anything, you first need to know the URL of the search result page. By looking at the browser’s address bar after doing a search, you can see that the result page has a URL like https://pypi.org/search/?q=<SEARCH_TERM_HERE>. The requests module can download this page and then you can use Beautiful Soup to find the search result links in the HTML. Finally, you’ll use the webbrowser module to open those links in browser tabs.\n",
      "Make your code look like the following:\n",
      "#! python3\n",
      "# searchpypi.py  - Opens several search results.\n",

      "# TODO: Open a browser tab for each result.\n",
      "The user will specify the search terms using command line arguments when they launch the program. These arguments will be stored as strings in a list in sys.argv.\n",
      "Step 2: Find All the Results\n",
      "Now you need to use Beautiful Soup to extract the top search result links from your downloaded HTML. But how do you figure out the right selector for the job? For example, you can’t just search for all <a> tags, because there are lots of links you don’t care about in the HTML. Instead, you must inspect the search result page with the browser’s developer tools to try to find a selector that will pick out only the links you want.\n",
      "After doing a search for Beautiful Soup, you can open the browser’s developer tools and inspect some of the link elements on the page. They can look complicated, something like pages of this: <a class=\"package-snippet\" href=\"HYPERLINK \"view-source:https://pypi.org/project/xml-parser/\"/project/xml-parser/\">.\n",
      "It doesn’t matter that the element looks incredibly complicated. You just need to find the pattern that all the search result links have.\n",

Looking through the rest of the HTML source, it looks like the package-snippet class is used only for search result links. You don’t have to know what the CSS class package-snippet is or what it does. You’re just going to use it as a marker for the <a> element you are looking for. You can create a BeautifulSoup object from the downloaded page’s HTML text and then use the selector '.package-snippet' to find all <a> elements that are within an element that has the package-snippet CSS class. Note that if the PyPI website changes its layout, you may need to update this program with a new CSS selector string to pass to soup.select(). The rest of the program will still be up to date.\n",
      "Step 3: Open Web Browsers for Each Result\n",
      "Finally, we’ll tell the program to open web browser tabs for our results. Add the following to the end of your program:\n",

      "    print('Opening', urlToOpen)\n",
      "    webbrowser.open(urlToOpen)\n",
      "By default, you open the first five search results in new tabs using the webbrowser module. However, the user may have searched for something that turned up fewer than five results. The soup.select() call returns a list of all the elements that matched your '.package-snippet' selector, so the number of tabs you want to open is either 5 or the length of this list (whichever is smaller).\n",
      "The built-in Python function min() returns the smallest of the integer or float arguments it is passed. (There is also a built-in max() function that returns the largest argument it is passed.) You can use min() to find out whether there are fewer than five links in the list and store the number of links to open in a variable named numOpen. Then you can run through a for loop by calling range(numOpen).\n",
      "On each iteration of the loop, you use webbrowser.open() to open a new tab in the web browser. Note that the href attribute’s value in the returned <a> elements do not have the initial https://pypi.org part, so you have to concatenate that to the href attribute’s string value.\n",
      "Now you can instantly open the first five PyPI search results for, say, boring stuff by running searchpypi boring stuff on the command line! (See Appendix B for how to easily run programs on your operating system.)\n",
      "Ideas for Similar Programs\n",
      "The benefit of tabbed browsing is that you can easily open links in new tabs to peruse later. A program that automatically opens several links at once can be a nice shortcut to do the following:\n",

You can use this as the filename when saving the image to your hard drive. You join this name with the name of your xkcd folder using os.path.join() so that your program uses backslashes (\\) on Windows and forward slashes (/) on macOS and Linux.

      "Controlling the Browser with the selenium Module\n",
      "The selenium module lets Python directly control the browser by programmatically clicking links and filling in login information, almost as though there were a human user interacting with the page. Using selenium, you can interact with web pages in a much more advanced way than with requests and bs4; but because it launches a web browser, it is a bit slower and hard to run in the background if, say, you just need to download some files from the web.\n",
      "Still, if you need to interact with a web page in a way that, say, depends on the JavaScript code that updates the page, you’ll need to use selenium instead of requests. That’s because major ecommerce websites such as Amazon almost certainly have software systems to recognize traffic that they suspect is a script harvesting their info or signing up for multiple free accounts. These sites may refuse to serve pages to you after a while, breaking any scripts you’ve made. The selenium module is much more likely to function on these sites long-term than requests.\n",
      "A major “tell” to websites that you’re using a script is the user-agent string, which identifies the web browser and is included in all HTTP requests. For example, the user-agent string for the requests module is something like 'python-requests/2.21.0'. You can visit a site such as https://www.whatsmyua.info/ to see your user-agent string. Using selenium, you’re much more likely to “pass for human” because not only is Selenium’s user-agent is the same as a regular browser (for instance, 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:65.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/65.0'), but it has the same traffic patterns: a selenium-controlled browser will download images, advertisements, cookies, and privacy-invading trackers just like a regular browser. However, selenium can still be detected by websites, and major ticketing and ecommerce websites often block browsers controlled by selenium to prevent web scraping of their pages.\n",

Unfortunately, the compatibility between versions of selenium and a browser sometimes breaks, and you may need to search the web for possible solutions.

      "Summary\n",
      "Most boring tasks aren’t limited to the files on your computer. Being able to programmatically download web pages will extend your programs to the internet. The requests module makes downloading straightforward, and with some basic knowledge of HTML concepts and selectors, you can utilize the BeautifulSoup module to parse the pages you download.\n",
      "But to fully automate any web-based tasks, you need direct control of your web browser through the selenium module. The selenium module will allow you to log in to websites and fill out forms automatically. Since a web browser is the most common way to send and receive information over the internet, this is a great ability to have in your programmer toolkit.\n",
      "Practice Questions\n",

      "5. How do you save a requests response to a file?\n",
      "6. What is the keyboard shortcut for opening a browser’s developer tools?\n",
      "7. How can you view (in the developer tools) the HTML of a specific element on a web page?\n",
      "8. What is the CSS selector string that would find the element with an id attribute of main?\n",
      "9. What is the CSS selector string that would find the elements with a CSS class of highlight?\n",
      "10. What is the CSS selector string that would find all the <div> elements inside another <div> element?\n",
      "11. What is the CSS selector string that would find the <button> element with a value attribute set to favorite?\n",
      "12. Say you have a Beautiful Soup Tag object stored in the variable spam for the element <div>Hello, world!</div>. How could you get a string 'Hello, world!' from the Tag object?\n",
      "13. How would you store all the attributes of a Beautiful Soup Tag object in a variable named linkElem?\n",
      "14. Running import selenium doesn’t work. How do you properly import the selenium module?\n",
      "15. What’s the difference between the find_element_* and find_elements_* methods?\n",
      "16. What methods do Selenium’s WebElement objects have for simulating mouse clicks and keyboard keys?\n",
      "17. You could call send_keys(Keys.ENTER) on the Submit button’s WebElement object, but what is an easier way to submit a form with selenium?\n",
      "18. How can you simulate clicking a browser’s Forward, Back, and Refresh buttons with selenium?\n",
      "Practice Projects\n",
      "For practice, write programs to do the following tasks.\n",
      "Command Line Emailer\n",
      "Write a program that takes an email address and string of text on the command line and then, using selenium, logs in to your email account and sends an email of the string to the provided address. (You might want to set up a separate email account for this program.)\n",
      "This would be a nice way to add a notification feature to your programs. You could also write a similar program to send messages from a Facebook or Twitter account.\n",
      "Image Site Downloader\n",
      "Write a program that goes to a photo-sharing site like Flickr or Imgur, searches for a category of photos, and then downloads all the resulting images. You could write a program that works with any photo site that has a search feature.\n",
      "2048\n",
      "2048 is a simple game where you combine tiles by sliding them up, down, left, or right with the arrow keys. You can actually get a fairly high score by repeatedly sliding in an up, right, down, and left pattern over and over again. Write a program that will open the game at https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ and keep sending up, right, down, and left keystrokes to automatically play the game.\n",
      "Link Verification\n",
      "Write a program that, given the URL of a web page, will attempt to download every linked page on the page. The program should flag any pages that have a 404 “Not Found” status code and print them out as broken links.\n",
